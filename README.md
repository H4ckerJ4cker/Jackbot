#### Docker
You can install JackBot using docker with the provided dockerfiles in the repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/pwnker/Jackbot

#### Bare Metal
If you prefer you can also install JackBot bare metal by cloning the repository and instaling the dependancies. You might want to set the enviroment variable `LOCAL_DEBUGGING=1` to stop JackBot trying to connect to a database if you havent set one up.
```
git clone https://github.com/pwnker/Jackbot
cd Jackbot
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt
python3 bot.py
``` 
#### Enviroment Variables

Make sure you set the correct environment variables either in the docker-compose.yml or in the bare metal installtion to ensure the bot functions correctly.

Setting `LOCAL_DEBUGGING=1` Will stop JackBot from trying to connect to a database and disable the command error handler.

If you are using the database features then you must also set the correct credentials in the environmet variables `PGUSER`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGHOST` and `PGPASSWORD`.

Of course also make sure you set the bot token using `BOT_TOKEN`
